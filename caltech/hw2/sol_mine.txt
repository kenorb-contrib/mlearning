1. my run gives 0.0377.
	(b)

2. average for c1/crand is almost equal to 0.5, and µ=0.5,
 thus they track µ, and thus they obey the Hoeffding's Inequality.
	(d)
?What about cmin??? It should satisfy SOME law..
cmin is what we are LOOK_FOR. It is the hypothesis that has least error.
However, it turns out it is NOT satisfying Hoeffdnig!
